                <h1 class="section-title">Our mission</h1>
                <p>The final objective of Onupark is the <strong>conservation of water-based ecosystems</strong> 
                    such as oceans, rivers and marshes. In today's world, <strong>ocean life</strong> is one 
                    of the most fragile because of the dependance these animals have in their enviroment and 
                    the susceptibility of these types of habitats to be contaminated as the flowing waters 
                    make so it's ease for <strong>contamination</strong> to end up in the ocean.
                </p>
                <p>In our park we have 3 main facilities, two for <strong>ocean life</strong>, warm and cold, 
                    and one for the <strong>local marsh fauna</strong>, mainly composed of migratory birds.

                <p>We have courses and school visits available! Bring your family to learn about nature and

                <p>We do not only have fish in our park, we also have a facility specialized on <strong>marsh fauna</strong>, mainly composed of <strong>migratory birds</strong> who stop in the Odiel's marsh to rest from their journey before continuing north or south.</p>
                <p>We get sure they get the best treatment, provide the best habitats for their temporary nests and, if they are not <strong>endangered</strong>, we let them continue their migration.

                <h1 class="section-title">Cleaning the oceans</h1>
                <p>There are currently <strong>75 to 199 million tons of plastic</strong> polluting our oceans, 
                    according to the <a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/06/recycling-global-statistics-facts-plastic-paper/" target="_blank">World Economic Forum</a>. 
                    This is a result of humans recycling only nine percent of plastic waste and dumping <strong>10 million 
                    tons of it into the seas</strong> each year.</p>
                <p>If we continue on this path, the annual flow of plastic into the ocean could <strong>triple by 2040</strong> 
                    as plastic production continues to increase. Marine plastic pollution may be costing the world economy 
                    trillions of dollars every year because it affects fisheries, coastlines, tourism, marine life, and the 
                    food we eat.</p>
                <p>The most high-profile effort to clean up ocean plastic is being conducted by 
                    <a href="https://theoceancleanup.com/" target="_blank">Ocean Cleanup</a>, a Dutch nonprofit whose goal 
                    is to get rid of <strong>90 percent of floating plastic</strong> pollution in the ocean. Its first collection system 
                    proved ineffective when plastic garbage was able to escape its barriers and a part broke off due to the 
                    winds and waves. Its more successful current iteration has removed <strong>220,000 pounds of plastic</strong> 
                    from the Great Pacific Garbage Patch.</p>
                <p>Here, in Onupark, we do our part in helping to remove ocean polution and create a better world for both our 
                    descendants and the animals of the future.</p>

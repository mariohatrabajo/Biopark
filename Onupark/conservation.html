                <h1 class="section-title">Coral reefs in danger</h1>
                <p><strong>Human-caused</strong>, or anthropogenic activities, are major threats to coral reefs. Pollution, 
                    overfishing, destructive fishing practices using dynamite or cyanide, collecting live corals for the 
                    aquarium market, <strong>mining coral</strong> for building materials, and a warming climate are some 
                    of the many ways that people damage reefs all around the world every day. </p>
                <p>One of the most significant threats to reefs is <strong>pollution</strong>. Land-based runoff and pollutant discharges can 
                    result from dredging, coastal development, agricultural and deforestation activities, and sewage 
                    treatment plant operations. This runoff may contain sediments, nutrients, chemicals, insecticides, oil, 
                    and debris. </p>
                <p>When some pollutants enter the water, nutrient levels can increase, promoting the rapid growth of 
                    <strong>algae</strong> and other organisms that can smother corals. </p>
                <p>Coral reefs also are affected by <strong>leaking fuels</strong>, anti-fouling paints and coatings, and 
                    other chemicals that enter the water. <strong>Petroleum spills</strong> do not always appear to affect 
                    corals directly because the oil usually stays near the surface of the water, and much of it evaporates 
                    into the atmosphere within days. 
                    However, if an oil spill occurs while corals are spawning, the eggs and sperm can be damaged as they 
                    float near the surface before they fertilize and settle. So, in addition to compromising water quality, 
                    oil pollution can disrupt the <strong>reproductive success of corals</strong>, making them vulnerable 
                    to other types of disturbances. </p>
                <p>In many areas, coral reefs are destroyed when coral heads and brightly-colored reef fishes are collected 
                    for the <strong>aquarium and jewelry trade</strong>. Careless or untrained divers can trample fragile 
                    corals, and many fishing techniques can be destructive. In <strong>blast fishing</strong>, dynamite or 
                    other heavy explosives are detonated to startle fish out of hiding places. This practice indiscriminately 
                    <strong>kills other species</strong> and can crack and stress corals so much that they expel their 
                    zooxanthellae. As a result, large sections of reefs can be destroyed.</p>

                <h1 class="section-title">A problem in Huelva</h1>
                <p>The storage of <strong>industrial wastes</strong> is a worldwide environmental problem. Among the most 
                    prolific industries generating solid wastes is the phosphate fertilizer industry. This generates large 
                    amounts of an acid residue called <strong>phosphogypsum</strong> (PG) during the production of 
                    <strong>phosphoric acid</strong> from phosphatic rocks. With a ratio of 5 t of PG per ton of phosphoric 
                    acid. The PG is stored in large retaining stockpiles.</p>
                <p>The major environmental problem concerning these stacks is their high <strong>contamination potential</strong> 
                    because PG accumulates naturally occurring <strong>toxic and radioactive elements</strong> in its mineral 
                    structure. While this environmental hazard represents a serious concern for the scientific community, 
                    <strong>little attention is paid</strong>, from the public domain, to the structural stability of the 
                    stacks, despite such stability exerts direct control on the safety storage of toxic PG. This disparity 
                    is well exemplified in the Huelva PG stack.</p>
                <p>The Huelva PG stack is located in an estuarine environment, very close to the Atlantic Ocean, and 
                    <strong>less than 0.5 km from the city of Huelva</strong>. Reaching heights of up to 25 m, this
                    wet embankment contains <strong>100 Mt of wastes</strong> occupying an area of about 1000 ha. The stack 
                    received residues of up to five nearby factories and was in operation since 1967 until
                    2010, when it was concealed after a Spanish National Court decision.</p>
                <p>In the last 20 years, but particularly since the closure of the disposal activity, several research studies 
                    revealed that the PG stack has an <strong>important contamination potential</strong> for
                    the estuary, the Atlantic Ocean and the citizen of Huelva.</p>
                <p>The estuary of Huelva is conformed by the confluence of the Tinto and Odiel rivers. These extend to the 
                    Atlantic Ocean through major estuarine channels bordered by relatively narrow tidal flats and surrounded 
                    by wide areas of inter-tidal salt marshes. The Huelva PG stack was placed at the right margin of the Tinto 
                    estuarine channel, settled directly over salt-marsh deposits, with <strong>no impermeable and protective 
                    cap in between</strong>.</p>
